** test a problem with just displacement BCS and test a problem with just traction BCS
-- this will confirm that they work independently. Then, I can combine!
** scaling the rows of the linear system
** constrain the ends of the unknown displacement field 
** why is bem_mat_mult taking a constant amount of time independent of the inputs? strange.
** more systematic python loading/viewing
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys! (Danson 1981 paper)
** load 3D problems
** calculate and output the tractions on the slip_mesh.
** how to test the elastic solver systematically?
