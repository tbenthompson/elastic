test a problem with just displacement BCS
get_meshes + get_bcs, not get_meshes_bcs
** potential problems:
-- scaling the rows of the linear system. why doesn't this work right?
-- constrain the ends of the unknown displacement field 
** why is bem_mat_mult taking a constant amount of time independent of the
inputs
** HOW TO TEST THE ELASTIC SOLVER SYSTEMATICALLY?
** come up with a more general way of specify the interactions terms?
** make another script to produce interior displacements
** more systematic python loading/viewing
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys! (Danson 1981 paper)
** load 3D problems
** more output from elastic solver
** calculate the tractions on the slip_mesh.
