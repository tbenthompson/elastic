** scale by length -- automatically determine length?
** Figure out proper sign conventions!
** why is the test_diag_free_slip so slow?
** why are some iterations very fast and others very slow? does this happen on meade02 with the intel compiler (seems to be more consistent)?
** ILU preconditioning
** a systematic way of saving a solution, recompute everything except the solution?
** some tools that perform automated refinement and produce a convergence plot
---- some other tools for automated debugging of specific problems
** (i think this is close) get the 3d sphere compression lame problem tests working
** test rotational invariance
** 3d interior evaluation
** refactor the interior tool to allow more integral equations
** gravity problems -- valleys in 2d! (Danson 1981 paper)
---- test case: 4.1.5 here: http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter4_1/Chapter4_1.htm
** a systematic golden master testing system?
