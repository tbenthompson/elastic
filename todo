** HOW TO TEST THE ELASTIC SOLVER SYSTEMATICALLY?
** refactor the elastic solver
** make another script to produce interior displacements
** more systematic python loading/viewing
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys! (Danson 1981 paper)
** load 3D problems
** do the same kernel checking for 2d elastic as 3d elastic
** more output from elastic solver
** calculate the tractions on the slip_mesh.
