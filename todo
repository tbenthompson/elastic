** switch the shear_modulus back in beam_bend and pressured_cylinder
** why is beam_bend divergent?
** start thinking about preconditioning
** quadrature order?
** cleaner interior evaluation
** simple refactorings on main.cpp (extract function, etc)
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys! (Danson 1981 paper)
** load 3D problems
** calculate and output the tractions on the slip_mesh.
