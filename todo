** why is the test_diag_free_slip so slow?
** begin integrating with fmm
** some tools that perform automated refinement and produce a convergence plot
---- some other tools for automated debugging of specific problems

** test rotational invariance
** test rigid body motion

** 3d interior evaluation
** refactor the interior tool to allow more integral equations

** get the 3d sphere compression lame problem tests working

** gravity problems -- valleys in 2d! (Danson 1981 paper)
---- test case: 4.1.5 here: http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter4_1/Chapter4_1.htm
** a systematic golden master testing system?
