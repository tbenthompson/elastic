** there appears to be super excessive memory usage -- are matrices being copied?
** 3d interior evaluation
** begin integrating with fmm
** 3d sphere compression lame problem tests
** problems with vertical free slip boundaries
** some tools that perform automated refinement and produce a convergence plot
---- some other tools for automated debugging of specific problems
** 3d assembly hanging for the cube problem
** refactor the interior tool to allow more integral equations
** extract functions in main and write some simple tests
** gravity problem -- valleys! (Danson 1981 paper)
---- test case: 4.1.5 here: http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter4_1/Chapter4_1.htm
** test rotational invariance
** test rigid body motion
