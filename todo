** ILU preconditioning
** a systematic way of saving a solution, recompute everything except the solution?
** some tools that perform automated refinement and produce a convergence plot
---- some other tools for automated debugging of specific problems
** (i think this is close) get the 3d sphere compression lame problem tests working
** test rotational invariance
---- test case: 4.1.5 here: http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter4_1/Chapter4_1.htm
** a systematic golden master testing system?
